Some projects

1. Project for the logic circuit computer lab, Simple logic gates such as AND, OR, and XOR are combined to create much more complex structures such as counters and SRAMs, in turn, to create a functioning Calendar with alarm and notifications.

2. Project for the elementary computer lab, Arduino is used to manage a home console which takes voice commands from phone and perform various functions(play music, set alarm, turn on light)

3. The code written for simulation of a water rocket, can be configured to simulate a rocket with boosters and multiple stages.

4. Machine learning project for image segmentation and deducing finger positions.
